# Project Information
In this challenge I created a website that allows you the user to generate
their own unique random password by clicking a generate button. This challenge
gives the option of choosing a length of 8 through 128 characters, lower case,
upper case, numbers, or even special characters. The user is given an error
if none of the options are picked, or if their length is not 8 through 128
characters.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
